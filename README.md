## Kindle + Raspberry Pi Weather Station

This is a work in progress for a fun and hopefully useful weather station at home. This repo is a
companion to a [blog post][blog-post] I wrote to set this whole thing up using scripts from others.
The work here is heavily modified to meet the specific needs of my setup, as well as to ease the
setup of this in the future, and facilitate iteration to more complex data display (I would like
internal and external temperature information collected directly by the Raspberry Pi itself to be
integrated into the data shown from weather services).

Since this is so custom, it's probably better to fork and configure it for your own needs. Pull
requests welcome to link out to blog posts and repos that use this.
